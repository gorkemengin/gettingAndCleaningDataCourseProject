### Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

### Submissions
1) README.md: this file
2) CodeBook.md: describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that performed to clean up the data
3) run_analysis.R: 
	1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
	3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
	5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
